# Contibution guideline
If you came here, I suppose you would like to add a somehting this list. To do it well, you should follow these rules.

1. Take a critical look: is the proposed thing really awesome?
2. If if, add this lib in the relevant section in the alphabetical right position. Bear in mind, that in many cases one source may fit multiple categories. Choose exactly one, to not duplicate contents.
3. Obviously, check if the library does not occur in the list!
4. The description should start with a capital letter and be ended with proper punctuation.
5. Feel free to propose any other changes in the list. New section? Removing an item? No problem, we'll think about it :sunglasses:
