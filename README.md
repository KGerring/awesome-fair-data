# awesome-fair-data
A curated list of awesome stuff around the FAIR principles for (scientific) data, i.e that data is findable, accessable, interoperable and re-usable.

## Resources about the FAIR principles

## FAIR Digital Object and related projects
[FAIR Digital Objects Forum](https://fairdo.org/)

[FAIR DO publications](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/data-fabric-ig/wiki/fair-do-publications)

[FAIR Digital Object Framework](https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/)

[RO Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)

## Organizations and Communities

[FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html)

## (Meta)data formats and standards

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)

[Schema.org](https://schema.org/)

[JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/)

## Finding datasets and software

[OpenAIRE explorer](https://explore.openaire.eu/) Search through the metadata indexed by openaire

[Datacite commons](https://commons.datacite.org/) Search through the metadata indexed by Datacite

[EuDat B2find](http://b2find.eudat.eu/) Search through metadata of datasets accumulated by EuDat

[Microsoft acadamy](https://academic.microsoft.com/home) Mircosoft acadamy search through a pid graph created by microsoft (shutdown end of 2021)

## Tools/Software for

### Provenance tracking

[AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA) is an open-source Python infrastructure to help researchers with automating, managing, persisting, sharing and reproducing the complex workflows associated with modern computational science and all associated data. Fully automated provenance tracking, but manual and semi automatic also possible.

[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) A free and open-source distributed data management system for everyone. It is based on git-annex with manual to automatic provenance tracking.

### Data management

### Metadata management

### Your own repository setup

[Invenio](https://invenio-software.org/) Open source customizable software to setup large scale digital repositories, library systems and data repositories

[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) Open source research data repository software 

[EuDat B2share](https://b2share.eudat.eu/) A repository by EuDat, but the software is open source and one can setup own instances of it.

### FAIR assessment

[F-uji](https://www.f-uji.net/) An (online) tool which can provide a FAIR score for a given PID based on a metric created by FAIRsFAIR
