# awesome-fair-data
A curated list of awesome stuff around the FAIR principles for (scientific) data, i.e that data is findable, accessable, interoperable and re-usable.

## Resources about the FAIR principles

## FAIR Digital Object and related projects
[FAIR Digital Objects Forum](https://fairdo.org/) General platform for discussions on the advancement and development of FAIR Digital Objects

[FAIR DO publications](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/data-fabric-ig/wiki/fair-do-publications) Relevant publications (concept papers and specs) by RDA working groups on FDOs

[FAIR Digital Object Framework](https://fairdigitalobjectframework.org/) A WIP specification for an FDO infrastructure based on linked data / RDF

[RO Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) Pragmatic approach combining existing technologies and ontologies into a metadata standard for annotating scientific datasets

## Organizations and Communities
[Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/) International organization and communication platform for establishing standards and recommendations concerning research data publication

[FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) A curated resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies. 

[The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html) Handbook and community for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.

[EuDat](https://www.eudat.eu/)

## (Meta)data formats and standards

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) Standard for the description of structural constraints in order to do validation of JSON objects

[Schema.org](https://schema.org/) Well-established and industry-accepted vocabulary providing semantics for common entities like Person, Organization, Dataset, etc.

[JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/) Convert JSON-LD data between various representations

## Finding datasets and software

[OpenAIRE explorer](https://explore.openaire.eu/) Search through the metadata indexed by openaire

[Datacite commons](https://commons.datacite.org/) Search through the metadata indexed by Datacite

[EuDat B2find](http://b2find.eudat.eu/) Search through metadata of datasets accumulated by EuDat

[Microsoft acadamy](https://academic.microsoft.com/home) Mircosoft acadamy search through a pid graph created by microsoft (shutdown end of 2021)

## Tools/Software for

### Provenance tracking

[AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA) is an open-source Python infrastructure to help researchers with automating, managing, persisting, sharing and reproducing the complex workflows associated with modern computational science and all associated data. Fully automated provenance tracking, but manual and semi automatic also possible.

[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) A free and open-source distributed data management system for everyone. It is based on git-annex with manual to automatic provenance tracking.

### Data management

### Metadata management

### Your own repository setup

[Invenio](https://invenio-software.org/) Open source customizable software to setup large scale digital repositories, library systems and data repositories

[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) Open source research data repository software 

[EuDat B2share](https://b2share.eudat.eu/) A repository by EuDat, but the software is open source and one can setup own instances of it.

### FAIR assessment

[F-uji](https://www.f-uji.net/) An (online) tool which can provide a FAIR score for a given PID based on a metric created by FAIRsFAIR
