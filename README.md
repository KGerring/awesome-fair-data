## (Meta)data formats and standards

* [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) Standard for the description of structural constraints in order to do validation of JSON objects

* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) Well-established and industry-accepted vocabulary providing semantics for common entities like Person, Organization, Dataset, etc.

* [JSON LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/) Convert JSON-LD data between various representations

## Ontology services
* [Ontobee](http://www.ontobee.org/) A linked ontology data server to support ontology term dereferencing, linkage, query and integration. 
See also this [publication](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/45/D1/D347/2770665)

* [Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) OLS is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions.

## Finding datasets and software

* [OpenAIRE explorer](https://explore.openaire.eu/) Search through the metadata indexed by openaire

* [Datacite commons](https://commons.datacite.org/) Search through the metadata indexed by Datacite

* [EuDat B2find](http://b2find.eudat.eu/) Search through metadata of datasets accumulated by EuDat

* [Citable code with Zenodo & GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) Make GitHub repositories citable with Zenodo DOI

## Tools/Software for

### Provenance tracking

* [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) Automated Interactive Infrastructure and Database for Computational Science (AiiDA) to automatically track provenance of complex workflows of modern computational science and all associated data, [code](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-core)

* [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) A free and open-source distributed data management system for everyone. It is based on git-annex with manual to automatic provenance tracking, [code](https://github.com/datalad/datalad).
