> A by the [Helmholtz metadata collaboration (HMC)](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en) curated list of awesome stuff around the FAIR principles for (scientific) data, i.e that data is findable, accessable, interoperable and re-usable. The list is organized in use cases of data producers, data users, data curators and data provides. 'FAIR' is not the same as 'open', but there is overlap.
